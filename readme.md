I have made a lot of changes recently and will update this readme in due time.

The BarnesMap function in the main.py file is probably the most important function I am using right now, it handles the full process from CSV-data -> Analysis -> Plotting, although it invokes multiple functions from Mapper.py (objectiveMap() in particular) as well as from analysis.py

More updates to come on the full process.
